- [x] **How does the Internet work?**
The Internet works by connecting networks through a series of routers and switches. 
A router sends data packets between different networks, while a switch connects 
devices within a single network. This enables computers to communicate with each
 other and access content stored on remote servers.

- [x] **What is HTTP?**
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This protocol was developed by Tim Berners-Lee 
at CERN (Switzerland), along with other concepts that served as the basis for the creation 
of the World Wide Web: HTML and theURI. While HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) defines 
how a website is constructed, HTTP determines how the page is transmitted from server 
to client. The third concept, theURL (Uniform Resource Locator), sets out how a resource (such as a website) is to be addressed on the Web.

- [x] **Browsers and how they work**
A browser is a mostly free program for viewing Internet pages. A web browser displays text, images, videos, links and other website functions. The term “ browser ‘ is derived from the verb ’browse” and means to look at, leaf through or navigate. With the introduction of hypertext, references to navigation were added, known ashyperlinks. In the meantime, the range of browser functions has expanded considerably: in addition to images and videos, interactive graphics, audio files, PDFs and other resources can now be integrated and provided with functions.

- [x] **DNS and how it works** - [x] **What is a domain name?**
DNS (Domain Name System) is the Internet's telephone directory. Internet users access 
online information via domain names (for example, nytimes.com or espn.com),
while browsers interact viaIP (Internet Protocol)addresses. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses so that browsers can load web resources.

- [x] **What is hosting?**
What is web hosting? In a nutshell, web hosting refers to the provision of storage space (on the Web) for the publication of Internet sites.
In this sense, websites are comparable to text documents. Documents can be saved to a computer's hard disk for recurrent consultation. Similarly, to be able to consult the content of websites at any time, anywhere in the world, this content needs to be stored, not on a local computer, but on a powerful server connected to the Internet 24 hours a day. In this way, the website created is available online at all times, and the content can be consulted by users all over the world. Such servers are usually provided by professional hosting providers.

## 2.  [Programming Languages]

**what is python**
Python is a cross-platform, cross-paradigm interpreted programming language. It supports structured, functional and object-oriented imperative programming. It features strong dynamic typing, automatic memory management via garbage collection and an exception handling system, making it similar to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, Smalltalk and Tcl.
The Python language is subject to an open-source license similar to the BSD license, and runs on most computing platforms, from smartphones to mainframes, from Windows to Unix, including GNU/Linux, via macOS, Android and iOS, and can also be translated into Java or .NET. It is designed to optimize programmer productivity by offering high-level tools and easy-to-use syntax.

**python history**
Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989 as a simple, readable language, inspired by the ABC language but more powerful and extensible. The name “Python” comes from the Monty Python comedy group, not from the snake. The first public version was released in 1991, with features such as exceptions and modules. Python evolved with major releases such as Python 2.0 (2000) and Python 3.0 (2008), becoming an essential language for web development, data science, artificial intelligence and education. Guido, nicknamed the “BDFL”, retired in 2018, but Python continues to thrive thanks to its open source community.

**advantages of python**
Python is appreciated for its simplicity and readability, making it easy to learn, even for beginners. It's a versatile language, suitable for a wide range of fields including the web, data science, artificial intelligence and automation. Its extensive library ecosystem and large community offer solutions for almost every need. Python is also portable (runs on all major platforms), interpreted (no need to compile) and supports several programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional). Its automatic memory management and interoperability with other languages make it a powerful tool for both simple and complex projects.
