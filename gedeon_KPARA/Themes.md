- [x] **How does the Internet work?**
The Internet works by connecting networks through a series of routers and switches. 
A router sends data packets between different networks, while a switch connects 
devices within a single network. This enables computers to communicate with each
 other and access content stored on remote servers.

- [x] **What is HTTP?**
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This protocol was developed by Tim Berners-Lee 
at CERN (Switzerland), along with other concepts that served as the basis for the creation 
of the World Wide Web: HTML and theURI. While HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) defines 
how a website is constructed, HTTP determines how the page is transmitted from server 
to client. The third concept, theURL (Uniform Resource Locator), sets out how a resource (such as a website) is to be addressed on the Web.

- [x] **Browsers and how they work**
A browser is a mostly free program for viewing Internet pages. A web browser displays text, images, videos, links and other website functions. The term “ browser ‘ is derived from the verb ’browse” and means to look at, leaf through or navigate. With the introduction of hypertext, references to navigation were added, known ashyperlinks. In the meantime, the range of browser functions has expanded considerably: in addition to images and videos, interactive graphics, audio files, PDFs and other resources can now be integrated and provided with functions.

- [x] **DNS and how it works** - [x] **What is a domain name?**
DNS (Domain Name System) is the Internet's telephone directory. Internet users access 
online information via domain names (for example, nytimes.com or espn.com),
while browsers interact viaIP (Internet Protocol)addresses. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses so that browsers can load web resources.

- [x] **What is hosting?**
What is web hosting? In a nutshell, web hosting refers to the provision of storage space (on the Web) for the publication of Internet sites.
In this sense, websites are comparable to text documents. Documents can be saved to a computer's hard disk for recurrent consultation. Similarly, to be able to consult the content of websites at any time, anywhere in the world, this content needs to be stored, not on a local computer, but on a powerful server connected to the Internet 24 hours a day. In this way, the website created is available online at all times, and the content can be consulted by users all over the world. Such servers are usually provided by professional hosting providers.
