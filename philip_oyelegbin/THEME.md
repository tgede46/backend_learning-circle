### Fundamental Concepts

- **How the Internet Works**

Instead of letters, we have data packets. These packets contain chunks of information like parts of websites, emails, or video calls. These packets travel across networks â€“ think of them as roads/path connecting different cities (computers).

Routers are like post offices that direct these packets along the fastest route to their destination. Every device on the internet has a unique address called an IP address, like a house number, so the data knows where to go.

- **What is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**

This is the kanguage of the web, it is a way the coputer comuniacates/talks to a website's server to get information.

Imagine you're at a restaurant. You (the client) use a menu (HTTP request) to tell the waiter (browser) what you want.
The kitchen (the website's server) prepares your order and sends it back on a plate (HTTP response) with your food (the website data).

- **Browsers and How They Work**

Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari are like fancy mail trucks. You type in an address (website URL), the browser fetches the website data packets, puts them together, and displays the website for you.

- **DNS and How It Works**

Remember those IP addresses? They're hard to remember, right? That's where DNS (Domain Name System) comes in. It's like a phonebook for the internet.

You type in a user-friendly domain name like "google.com".
Your computer asks a DNS server "Hey, what's the IP address for google.com?"
The DNS server looks it up and gives your computer the IP address. Now, your browser knows where to send the request.

- **What is a Domain Name?**

It's simply the human-readable address of a website, like "google.com". It makes it easier for us to remember and access websites.

- **What is Hosting?**

Hosting is like renting space on a powerful computer (server) connected to the internet. This server stores all the files and data that make up your website. When someone types in your domain name, their browser connects to your hosting server to access and display your website.

**In a nutshell:**
You enter a website address (domain name).
The DNS translates it into an IP address.
Your browser sends an (HTTP request) to the server at that IP address.
The hosting (server) sends back the website data (HTTP response).
Your browser displays the website.
That's a simplified explanation.
